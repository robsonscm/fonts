MADD9013 Font Pairings Assignment


Font Pairings

Take the two provided HTML files (do NOT change the file names) and edit their linked CSS to provide a different pair of fonts, one serif and one sans-serif.

On one page use a Sans-Serif font for the headings and the Serif font for the body text.

On the other page, use a Serif font for the headings and the Sans-Serif font for the body text.

Use a DIFFERENT font pair on each page.

Other than editing the CSS, the only changes in the HTML should be:

1. to add your name as the content for the <h1> element.

2. To add a SINGLE <link> that points to your Google Fonts. This link should be above your other CSS links. (or you can use the @import at the top of your CSS file to import the Google Font CSS)



In your CSS, EVERY font-family property must use a font-stack that includes 1. your google font, 2. a matching serif or sans-serif font that is available on OSX and Windows (use two if needed), 3. the generic fallback "serif" or "sans-serif".

Submission

Create a Github Repo called fonts.

Add the gh-pages branch and set it as the default branch.

Commit your two HTML files to the gh-pages branch in your fonts repository.

Submit the link to one of your html pages here.

eg: https://abcd0001.github.io/fonts/index.html (Links to an external site.)

Make sure that your pages are called index.html and fonts.html

Remember to test the link that you submit to be sure that it works.
